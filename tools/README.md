- ## 1. Resoving of dynamic externet IP

> Obtain the exit IP of the company's intranet host (because the operator will change it at any time), and then use the router (or switch, etc.) port mapping, so as to achieve the same domain name resolution to the dynamic extrnet IP.

Usage:

```bash
$PROJECT_HOME/tools/outlink-dns/install.sh
```
